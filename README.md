## Inspiration
Google Keep, Tinder, Chefkoch
## What it does
The app allows the user to manage his grocery lists and in addition select what he has already bought (which represents the barcode scanning in real life). For curious users, we also built in the 'Recipe Browser' that offers Tinder-like functionality. Instead of searching for the perfect human match, here the user is searching for new favorite recipes.
## How we built it
We used Google Flutter to create this project. This way, we are not constrained by Android, but can also publish the app to iOS and as a website.
## Challenges we ran into
Due to time constraints and as we are just 2 programmers we were not able to implement all the ideas we had, but instead just the most important ones.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
That we created a fully functional app using live API data that is actually fetched from the Migros server. Also, we currently have a lot of fun finding new recipes to cook ourselves using the Recipe-Tinder functionality. Additionally, we are proud that we have come this far with the implementation of the app given our (wo)man power.
## What we learned
How to use the Elasticsearch API inside Flutter and we also discovered some new Flutter widgets.
## What's next for Foodster
Publishing it as a website and adding more features, like using more of the offered data (e.g. showing product regionality - 30% of the products in your cart are from Swiss, 10% from Austria, ...; a barcode scanner to scan products, ...).
